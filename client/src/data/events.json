      "Lideta Sub-City has officially inaugurated its new Digital Service Center, marking a major step toward modernizing public service delivery and expanding access to fast, transparent, and citizen-friendly government services. The opening ceremony, held at the sub-city administration compound, was attended by senior officials, technology partners, community representatives, and local residents who welcomed the initiative with enthusiasm.",
